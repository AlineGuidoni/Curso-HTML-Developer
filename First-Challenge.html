    <h2 id="emergence-internet">The emergence of the Internet</h2>
    <small><a href="#inicio">(Voltar)</a></small>
    <p><blockquote> Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of  information stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system.
       Another catalyst in the formation of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be disseminated even after a nuclear attack. This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that ultimately evolved into what we now know as the Internet. ARPANET was a great success but membership was limited to certain academic and research organizations who had contracts with the Defense Department. In response to this, other networks were created to provide information sharing.
       January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Prior to this, the various computer networks did not have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was established called Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of computers on different networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the TCP/IP standard on January 1, 1983, hence the birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a universal language.</blockquote>

    <h2 id="HTML">How HTML works?</h2>
    <small><a href="#inicio">(Voltar)</a></small>
    <p><blockquote> works by using a series of tags to inform a browser what it should be doing with text on page and where it should be loading further resources from. There are over 100   HTML tags currently available to use, although most sites will only need a handful of these to work as they should.
     There are three HTML tags that are necessary for each page. These are <html>, <head>, and <body>. To indicate to a webpage that you are using HTML, each page will open with <html> and close with </html>. The <head> tag contains metadata not visible on-page but important for functionality, and the <body> tag denotes where the body content of a page resides. Each of these necessary elements can only be used once per page.</blockquote>

    <h2 id="tags">What are HTML Tags?</h2>
    <small><a href="#inicio">(Voltar)</a></small>
    <p><blockquote> HTML tag is a particular word or letter enclosed by angle brackets, < and >. You utilize tags to build HTML components, such as sentences or links.The HTML code is read from top to bottom and left to right by a web browser when viewed on a computer screen. HTML documents and their characteristics are created and rendered using HTML tags. The properties of HTML tags vary from one another.
       A web browser must tell the difference between plain text and HTML text in an HTML file. You can use unlimited tags in your code in HTML files.

    <h4><b>More about HTML:</b></h4>
    <h5>What does the acronym HTML mean?</h5>
    <h5><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> it is a markup language for developing pages and electronic documents for the internet, providing information for users, browsers and search engines.</h5>
    <h5><blockquote> HTML5 is the most recent version of HTML. With each version comes new abilities, etc. However, it is ever-advancing and evolving. HTML5 offers more functionality than previous iterations of the language. For example:</blockquote></h5>
    <ul><blockquote>
        <li>It can support audio and video using the relevant tags, <audio> & <video>.</li>
        <li>It is supported by all browsers including Chrome, Safari, Mozilla, and more. </li>
        <li>It is easier to use than older versions.</li>
        <li>It works better on mobile devices.</li></blockquote>
